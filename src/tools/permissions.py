src/tools/permissions.py â€” minimal role-based access control (RBAC)

RBAC = Role-Based Access Control. Instead of granting permissions to specific
people, we grant them to roles (e.g., "manager"). Anyone with that role can do
the action. This keeps rules simple and scalable.

Usage:
    from tools.permissions import has_permission
    if not has_permission(user_role, "create_invoice"):
        raise PermissionError("You do not have permission.")

        `has_permission(...)` is explicit and readable in code. You may see
